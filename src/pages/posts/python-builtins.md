## \[WIP\]

- The fact that (most) builtins come from the `builtins` module
- Interesting ones like `format`, `sorted`, `any` and `vars`
- Interacting with `locals` and `globals`
- Descriptors: `property`, `staticmethod`, etc.
- Truly dynamic: `eval` and `exec`
- Interesting data types: `frozenset`, `complex`, `memoryview`, etc.
- `iter` and `next`
- `code` type and the `compile` function
- `print(dir(__builtins__))`

So the localhost on my laptop won‚Äôt be able to access the localhost on my phone.</p><p>So, I asked Google for help. And I got a large number of solutions, the most sensible one being ‚Äúuse the internal IP address of your PC‚Äù, et voil√†.</p><h1 id="the-bad-way">The Bad way</h1><p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tgakgpfuw4eyvjud9tin.png" alt="image"></p><figcaption>Use ipconfig if you're on windows</figcaption><p>Running <code>ip addr</code> on my machine tells me that the laptop‚Äôs internal IP is <code>192.168.29.76</code>.</p><p>And sure enough, as long as both devices were using the same Wi-Fi network, accessing <code>http://192.168.29.76:8000</code> instead of <code>http://localhost:8000</code> did work. My Android app can now make web requests to my local backend server üéâ</p><p>But this solution is‚Ä¶ a bit unstable.</p><p>The internal IP of your laptop can keep changing whenever it connects to Wi-Fi, depending on various factors. And everytime it changes, you have to change the URL in your app‚Äôs code, which is not ideal.</p><p>There‚Äôs other ways as well like using ngrok, but it faces similar issues.</p><h1 id="the-correct-easy-way">The Correct, easy way</h1><p>use <code>adb reverse</code>.</p><p>Yup, that‚Äôs it.</p><p>Connect your android device to your pc via USB, ensure you have <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/">adb setup</a>, and run this in your terminal:</p><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">adb reverse tcp:8000 tcp:8000
</code></pre><p>Now, your mobile can access <code>localhost:8000</code>, just like your PC. (you can replace <code>8000</code> with whichever port you want to forward)</p><h1 id="why-did-nobody-tell-me-this">Why did nobody tell me this?</h1><p>Yeah, I was also surprised when I was unable to find anyone on Google or StackOverflow mentioning the existence of <code>adb reverse</code> when I tried to look for it.</p><p>Which is why I wrote this blog. Now hopefully, <code>adb reverse</code> will become more popular.</p><p>If you know why <code>adb reverse</code> isn‚Äôt as popular, let me know. Also, if you know another android developer that should know about this little productivity hack, why not share this blog with them? :P</p><hr><p>Cover image courtesy of <a href="https://unsplash.com/@ffstop?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Fotis Fotopoulos</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p></main></div></article></div></body></html>
